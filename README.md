# frisk
Frisk is a simple but powerful Test Driven Development (TDD) framework for C++ projects of all sizes. TDD is an excellent development ideology in which the developer first writes tests and then writes code in order to satisfy the tests. It prevents horrible bugs from becoming deeply embedded in large projects.

The TDD process typically follows this standard routine: 1) Design an interface; 2) Design and write a test that thoroughly tests all cases, especially corner cases, of the interface; 3) Execute the test and determine which tests fail and which succeed; 4) If a test fails, change or add implementation so that the test no longer fails. If it fails, go back to stack 3. If it passes, move on to the next test. 4) If all tests succeed, you have successfully implemented the interface/features.
